I love the new update! The UI is so smooth and everything loads faster.
The package arrived late and the support team didn’t respond for two days.
It’s okay overall—nothing special, but it does the job.
Absolutely terrible experience. Would not recommend to anyone.
Great value for money. I’ll definitely buy again!
